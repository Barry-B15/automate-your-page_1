			In Python, a variable is a way of giving a <span class="bold">name</span> to some <span class="bold">value</span>.<br>          Written as <span class="code">Name = Expression</span> <br>where name can be any sequence of letters, or letters and numbers as well as underscores.          The value of a name is the value that it refers to.          Once we have defined that variable we can change the value. And when we use the name again, it refer to the new value.          For example;<br> sum3 = 3 + 3 <br> sum3 = sum3 + 3 <br> Output 9(not 6)

        <ul>
          <li>They improve code readability by using names that make sense to humans.</li>
          <li>They give us a way to store the value of important data.
          </li>
          <li>They provide a way for us to use stored values</li>
          <li>They give us a way to change the value of something (like in the line <span class="code">days = days-1</span></li>

		  And the code <span class="bold">"2" + "2"</span> would paste the two strings together to give a new string		  <span class="code">"22"</span>.

			What is a <span class="bold">function or procedure</span>?
		</div>
		<div class="concept_description">
			A function(or procedure) is a part of a            program that takes <span class="bold">inputs</span>, process them and produce some            <span class="bold">outputs</span> or modify some parameter(s).<br> A general form is:"]<br><br>            <span class="code"> &lt;function&gt;(&lt;input&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;input&gt; ......)</span> <br><br>            Inputs are also called <span class="bold">operands</span>, <span class="bold">arguments</span> or            <span class="bold">parameters</span>. The number of outputs and inputs must match.

		<div class="concept_title">
			The difference between making and using a function
		</div>
		<div class="concept_description">
			To make a function, line1 starts with the keyword            <span class="code">def</span>, followed by a space, then function name, followed by the function parameters            enclosed in parentheses. These parameters are given actual values when used(or called). Line1 ends with colons             after the closing parentheses. Line2 starts with indentation,  then the body of the function, that is the code            that specifies what the function does with the input parameter(s).<br><br><span class="code">            def my_name(first_name, last_name): <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; full_name = first_name +  + last_name <br>            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return full_name </span>. <br><br> <span class="bold">To use a function</span>,            we write the name of the function,  give actual values to the parameters in parentheses.<br>For example; the above            function with first_name(John) and last_name(Doe), we write:<br><br>            <span class="code"> print my_name ("John", "Doe")</span> <br><br>         				Will output: John Doe

			How useful are functions to programmers?
		</div>
		<div class="concept_description">
			Functions are great tools for taking care of repetitive tasks. They free us from             having to go through repeating the same thing over and over again. It would be very difficult and even boring for a programmer             to teach a computer for example, how to convert fahrenheit to celsius everytime he wants to use it in his program before using it.             But with a simple function, all he needs to do is call the function.

	<div class="concept" id="lesson-3.4"> <!-- May have to manually change lesson id -->
		<div class="concept_title">
			What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?
		</div>
		<div class="concept_description">
			The return statement in a function is what tells Python what to output.             So if we were to write a function without a return statement; when we print, Python will output <span class="code">None</span>

			Using Functions to Generate HTML

			Programmers use functions to generate HTML codes for web pages. It helps them avoid repetition             and save time writing ccodes for very big projects.<br>            The attached function <span class="code"> def generate_concept_HTML(concept_title, concept_description)</span> (by ANDY)              will generate a simple HTML codes that we can copy to our webpage.

In comparisons, we use (==) for equality.<br>              The following function takes one argument and return "True" if the input is 16 or "False" as              output if the value is not 16. <br><br> <span class="code">                def age(x):<br>                  &nbsp;&nbsp;if x == 16:<br>                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "True"<br>                  &nbsp;&nbsp;else:<br>                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "False"                    </span>

Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.</p></li>              <li>Work from example code <p> If your modified code does not work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example              code until it does what you want.</p></li>              <li>Make sure examples work <p> Just because you find example code does not mean it will work in your system. Check the example code              you are using to make sure it behaves the way you expect. </p></li>              <li>Check (print) intermediate results <p>When your code  does not crash, but does not behave as expected, add print statements to your              program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.</p></li>              <li>Keep and compare old versions <p> When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code.              This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many new bugs.</p></li>           </ol>

			Do not Panic!<br> When you see a complex problem, don ot panic, take a look, think!                        And take the following steps to solve programming problems. <br>      			    <ol>      				<li>What are the inputs? <p>The first step is to understand what the inputs are and how the inputs are presented </p></li>      				<li> What are the outputs? <p>The next step is to know the expected outputs are.</p></li>      				<li>Solve the problem. <p>Consider how you would solve the problem as a human. Look for simple ways to solve the problem </p></li>      				<li>Simple mechanical solution.<p>Write small bits of code, test them to see how they work and what they do.
